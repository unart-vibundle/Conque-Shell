== Requirements ==

   * Python-enabled Vim 7.0+
   * Some functionality only available on Linux-like system with pty libraries

Copy files from conque/ into your .vim directory, for example:

$HOME/.vim/plugin/conque.vim
$HOME/.vim/syntax/conque.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/conque.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/subprocess.vim
$HOME/.vim/autoload/subprocess/proc_py.vim

:Conque bash

To open Conque in a new horizontal or vertical buffer use:

:ConqueSplit <command>
or
:ConqueVSplit <command>

== Troubleshooting ==

The most common problem will be not having Python enabled in your installation of Vim. Recent versions of Vim should come with Python enabled by default. To check for Python, run the ":version" command and check for "+python". If instead you see "-python" or "+python/dyn", it may mean you will need to install it.

 - Windows -

The default installation of GVim on Windows comes with "+python/dyn", which means python can be installed independently of Vim and loaded at runtime. Towards the bottom of the ":version" command in the "Compilation" section, look for a config option that looks something like -DDYNAMIC_PYTHON_DLL="python24.dll". This will let you know which version of python you need to install, in this case version 2.4. Go to http://www.python.org/ to download the version that your installation of Vim requires. NOTE: installing an earlier or newer version will probably not work.

 - Mac -

The latest version of MacVim will have Python enabled. See http://code.google.com/p/macvim/

 - Linux -

Most installations of Vim 7+ these days come built with Python.
